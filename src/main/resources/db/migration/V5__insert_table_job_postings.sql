<p>Globally, 80% of workers don’t have a desk or an office. These workers are the backbone of the global economy, the people we interact with every day in stores, on buses, in our hospitals, delivering our parcels, and maintaining our buildings. The current generation of workplace technology doesn’t fit their needs, Blink enables those people to be productive, informed, and engaged while on the move.</p>
<p>We\'ve built a fresh approach to an old problem. Our goal is to be the #1 choice for the mobile enterprise, to build the workplace "super-app" that brings together in one place the people and information that matter.</p>
<p>We\'re motivated, positive and social; we\'re all different, but these traits tie us together. We work closely as a team and genuinely value each other\'s opinions. Most of all, we try and learn as much as we can from one another, through knowledge sharing and healthy debate.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>💻 What will you be doing?</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be working as part of our Product Support team to take our customer-centric ethos to the next level, with a specific focus on product queries and technical issue escalations.

<ul>
 <li>Delivering outstanding customer centric product and technical support that enhances customer perceptions of Blink and increases satisfaction, credibility and trust.</li>

<p>Resolution and Escalation.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Upskilling in partnership with the rapid response engineering team to own more resolutions independently, leveraging the API and other tools provided to make updates in the back end systems.</li>

 <li>An obsession with top class support – over communicating with a service mindset and a desire to give users the best experience possible, regardless of the situation.</li>
 <li>You will be someone who holds themselves to the highest possible standards; not happy to merely meet an SLA, you will move with urgency to resolve customer requests because that’s how you create exceptional customer experience and exceed expectations.</li>

<p>At Help Scout, we’re on a mission to help businesses delight more customers<strong>. </strong>We’ve been on this journey since 2011, and today more than 12,000 companies use our platform to provide outstanding customer support. We’ve been <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/remote-culture/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">fully remote</a> from the beginning, and have a team of 140+ people all over the world.</p>
<p>We love crafting beautiful products and growing a business together, but we\'re also trying to do something bigger. We\'re building a company that brings out your best <em>and</em> leaves the world a better place — a company that seeks <strong>balance</strong> between profit and purpose. That\'s why we\'ve been a <a href="https://www.bcorporation.net/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Certified B Corporation</a> since 2019 and have <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/for-good/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">pledged 1%</a> of our equity back to the community.</p>
<p>Help Scout’s success hinges on hiring talented, high-accountability people who want to be part of creating a culture where we all feel challenged and supported to do our best work. We hope that excites you to join us!</p>
<h2><strong>Company values</strong></h2>
<h3><em>Happy to Help</em></h3>
<p>Help is our first name. We show up for others, not because we have to, but because we want to. We share knowledge and give freely by default, and operate with generosity and empathy for each other, our customers, and our community. After all, there is no I in team (or software).</p>
<h3><em>Craft over Convention</em></h3>
<p>Although it’s tempting to follow a well-worn path, we push ourselves to run beyond it — even when that sets us apart from our peers. We’re building a culture where it’s safe to be ambitious and hold each other to high standards. That’s why we obsess over the last 10%, because it shows up for our customers and the business in powerful ways.</p>
<h3><em>Progress not Perfection</em></h3>
<p>The work of building a product, culture, and brand is never done – we ship our best effort, listen, iterate, then repeat. Seeking progress requires the vulnerability to be curious, humble, and hungry to learn. Great ideas can come from anywhere, so we share our work openly, welcome the perspective of others, and continuously search for what can be improved.</p>
<h3><em>Own the Outcome </em></h3>
<p>Ownership is key to our collective success. We consider the impact on our team and our community before we act, and believe that trust and integrity are non-negotiable. To create a better future, our decisions are made with stakeholders today <em>and</em> ten years from now in mind.</p>
<p>Read more about how we define, share, and live these values <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/aligning-culture-with-values/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Your Impact</h2>
<p>Your focus is helping customers successfully adopt critical features that correlate directly with long-term retention. We measure the success of these efforts with our in-house customer health score. When you move the needle on this number, you\'ll fundamentally impact the company\'s long-term success.<br></p>
<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>You’ll be reporting to our VP of Customers, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abigail-phillips-35a546158/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Abigail Phillips</a>. You\'ll work closely with our Customer Education Lead, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alisongroves/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Alison Groves</a> and Docs Lead, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanie-r-shears/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Melanie Shears</a> to create cohesive learning pathways for customers. Cross-team, you’ll interact regularly with our Director of Sales, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dillonmcdermott/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Dillon McDermott</a> and Director of Account Management, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sewar-nasser-18a37a98/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Sewar Nasser</a>. You’ll also work alongside support team members, account managers, sales, and product team members.</p>
<h2>Timezone Note</h2>
<p>We are a globally distributed team, but this role must be located in Eastern, Central, Mountain, or Pacific time zones.</p>
<p>We are only able to hire in the <strong>United States</strong> for this role.</p>
<h2>About the Role</h2>
<p>You\'ll be instrumental in establishing, shaping, and growing our Customer Enablement function. At Help Scout, customer enablement focuses on strategically scaling our impact across our diverse SMB customer base through a balanced approach of targeted human interaction and scalable self-service resources. This differs from traditional customer success by emphasizing the creation of scalable enablement systems rather than relationship management. <br><br>
 Specifically, this looks like:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p><strong>Strategic customer selection</strong>: Identifying and prioritizing high-value customers and critical use cases where direct, 1-on-1 guidance will have the most meaningful impact on customer outcomes</p></li>
 <li>
  <p><strong>Insight-driven scaling</strong>: Translating patterns, trends, and learnings from direct customer interactions into comprehensive educational content, documentation, and self-service tools that empower the broader customer base</p></li>
 <li>
  <p><strong>Efficient resource allocation</strong>: Balancing personalized support for key segments with scalable enablement resources that serve customers across different growth stages and engagement levels</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At first, you’ll be a one-person show, creating the playbook for Customer Enablement, figuring out what works, and learning the product inside and out. When there’s a clear business case to grow the team, we trust you to do that. There’s a clear path to a Director-level role as you make progress. If you’ve already had a lot of success as a Director already, we’re open to considering that option from day one.</p>
<p>Here’s what a week at Help Scout might cover:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>You may conduct a couple of onboarding sessions with new customers, do some personalized customer outreach, or join a Sales call to explain our onboarding programs and answer product questions.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>You’ll experiment with new ways to engage with the customers and improve the customer health metric. Although our churn is very low relative to the benchmarks, we see a ton of opportunities in the data to do better, and we’re eager to hear your ideas.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Since you’ve spent time listening and learning from customers, you’ll spend time synthesizing your learnings, communicating them with the broader organization, and ensuring we’re working on the most valuable things for customers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your primary responsibilities will be leading our Onboarding program and identifying opportunities where working 1:1 with customers can improve their customer health score.</p>
<p>You\'ll be instrumental in establishing, shaping, and growing our Customer Enablement function— by defining success metrics, applying measurement frameworks, and directly working with customers to improve their experience.<br></p>
<h2>About You</h2>
<p><strong>Customer Advocate:</strong> You always have the customer’s back. You take the time to understand their unique pain points and use case, and you use all tools available to help solve their problem. You bring a solid technical understanding of SaaS products and can translate features into value for both customers and sales prospects. You are comfortable driving larger impact by advocating cross-team for product changes and resources to help support customers.</p>
<p><strong>Curious &amp; Adaptable:</strong> You\'re comfortable with ambiguity and excited by the opportunity to shape and define processes where they don\'t yet exist. You’re collaborative with teammates and energized by building new programs in fast-evolving environments.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic thinker</strong> <strong>and driver</strong>: You’re able to understand the bigger picture even while operating in a short-term space. You take a strategic, experimental approach—balancing short-term needs with a long-term vision. You have strong project management skills with the ability to prioritize initiatives based on potential customer impact on health scores.</p>
<p><strong>Exceptional Communicator</strong>: You’re confident leading onboarding sessions—from kickoff to training and optimization—and know how to tailor experiences for different customer needs.</p>
<p><strong>Results-oriented:</strong> You’re data-driven and analytical, using metrics to guide program development and measure effectiveness. You have experience creating impactful training programs that drive user adoption and retention, or you’ve seen it done and have your ideas that you’re eager to try.</p>

<p>At Help Scout, we’re on a mission to help businesses delight more customers<strong>. </strong>We’ve been on this journey since 2011, and today more than 12,000 companies use our platform to provide outstanding customer support. We’ve been <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/remote-culture/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">fully remote</a> from the beginning, and have a team of 140+ people all over the world.</p>
<p>We love crafting beautiful products and growing a business together, but we\'re also trying to do something bigger. We\'re building a company that brings out your best <em>and</em> leaves the world a better place — a company that seeks <strong>balance</strong> between profit and purpose. That\'s why we\'ve been a <a href="https://www.bcorporation.net/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Certified B Corporation</a> since 2019 and have <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/for-good/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">pledged 1%</a> of our equity back to the community.</p>
<p>Help Scout’s success hinges on hiring talented, high-accountability people who want to be part of creating a culture where we all feel challenged and supported to do our best work. We hope that excites you to join us!</p>
<h2><strong>Company values</strong></h2>
<h3><em>Happy to Help</em></h3>
<p>Help is our first name. We show up for others, not because we have to, but because we want to. We share knowledge and give freely by default, and operate with generosity and empathy for each other, our customers, and our community. After all, there is no I in team (or software).</p>
<h3><em>Craft over Convention</em></h3>
<p>Although it’s tempting to follow a well-worn path, we push ourselves to run beyond it — even when that sets us apart from our peers. We’re building a culture where it’s safe to be ambitious and hold each other to high standards. That’s why we obsess over the last 10%, because it shows up for our customers and the business in powerful ways.</p>
<h3><em>Progress not Perfection</em></h3>
<p>The work of building a product, culture, and brand is never done – we ship our best effort, listen, iterate, then repeat. Seeking progress requires the vulnerability to be curious, humble, and hungry to learn. Great ideas can come from anywhere, so we share our work openly, welcome the perspective of others, and continuously search for what can be improved.</p>
<h3><em>Own the Outcome </em></h3>
<p>Ownership is key to our collective success. We consider the impact on our team and our community before we act, and believe that trust and integrity are non-negotiable. To create a better future, our decisions are made with stakeholders today <em>and</em> ten years from now in mind.</p>

You’ll be a voice for the customer, ensuring the company is learning from customer experiences with the product (both good and bad!). And as a member of the Customers Team, you’ll help our team develop and refine systems to make sure we’re always improving.</p>
<p>Our ideal hire is motivated by what we’re doing as a company, believes in the value of quality technical support, and is eager to contribute to the success of our customers. As someone who is first in line to help, your understanding of the product and our customers will be incredibly valuable.</p>
<h2><br>
 About the Role</h2>
<p>The entire team works out of the main queue, so you’ll spend much of your day helping potential and current customers via email. If you’re curious to hear how our team works together, check out <a href="https://www.helpscout.net/webinars/working-in-a-collaborative-support-model/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"><u>this webinar</u></a>. While email support will be the majority of your day, everyone on the team helps out in Beacon chat, and you’ll also hop on impromptu calls with customers when needed.</p>
<p>You’ll become an expert in all areas of the product. You’ll troubleshoot potential bugs, document feature requests, and collaborate with the rest of the team to help elevate the voice of the customer at Help Scout. We’ll help set you up for success to become a mindful, contributing member of our support team. Specialists help a minimum of about 250 customers a month, but we won’t overburden you with quotas, empty policies, or unnecessary procedures. Doing what’s in the best interest of the customer is at the heart of what we do.<br><br><strong>Career Growth on the Customers Team</strong></p>

  <span>About Venteur </span>
 </div>
 <div>
  <span>At Venteur, we\'re dedicated to transforming healthcare in America. Our mission is to empower individuals to take control of the trillions of dollars spent on their behalf but often decided by human resources and brokers. We believe this will lead to better outcomes for all individuals. </span>
 </div>
 <div>
  <span>The market transformation is just starting. As we saw 40 years ago with the transition from company-controlled retirement (pensions) to individual-empowered retirement (401ks), new regulation has enabled healthcare to make the same transition from group plans to an individual focused solution – an Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (ICHRA). Through our technology-led offering, our platform changes how businesses offer health benefits, and how employees are empowered to truly prioritize wellness and longevity. </span>
 </div>
 <div>
  <span>We\'re seeking passionate individuals who thrive on exploration and learning to join us on this journey. With an early-stage startup, opportunities for career growth and advancement are immense along with the financial benefits of being an early employee of a future giant in technology. If you\'re a problem solver with empathetic communication skills, we want you to help us pave the way towards a healthier, more personalized future. Join Venteur and be part of something truly transformative! </span>

<p><b>This is a Dubai-based role. You must live in the Dubai area to be eligible for hire. You must speak both Arabic and English fluently.</b></p>
<p><span>DataRobot’s Applied Data Science Associate program (ADSA) is designed to provide qualified individuals with the training and experience necessary to become a Data Science Associate in approximately 6 months. This intense program is for the self-motivated and intellectually curious. The program will offer you opportunities to learn from the world’s foremost experts in AI and apply your new found knowledge in the frontier of AI.

<p><b><b>How</b></b><br></p>
<p><span>The Applied Data Science Associate program is centered around the Customer Facing Data Scientist Competencies. These are the competencies that must be developed and mastered to become a successful Data Scientist. There are 4 core competencies:</span><br><b><span> </span></b></p>
<p><b><b>Data Science</b></b></p>
<p><span>We focus on developing expertise in the data science necessary to help our customers be successful, primarily with the DataRobot platform. Thus we focus first on classification, regression, time series, and anomaly detection, along with all the associated data preprocessing and algorithms. We also focus on developing proficiency in wrangling data with tools like Python and R. This competency is the one that will be most tailored to the individual. </span></p>
<p><b><b>Product</b></b></p>
<p><span>The Data Scientist has to be an expert on the functionality of the DataRobot platform, both with the GUI as well as with the Python and R clients.</span><br></p>
<p><b><b>Sales</b></b></p>
<p><span>To be a trusted advisor, the Data Scientist must be able to establish trust and build meaningful relationships with customers. This requires the ability to listen, empathize, and more.</span><br></p>
<p><b><b>Management Consulting</b></b></p>
<p><span>Sometimes a Data Scientist is advising an end-user, e.g. a business analyst or a data scientist, on a particular project. Other times they are consulting with the senior management, helping to create a vision for how machine learning can benefit the company’s bottom line. This requires understanding how the company generates value and identifying opportunities (use cases) to reduce costs or increase revenue, quantifying the impact of those use cases, and then prioritizing and planning the execution of those projects so that the customer realizes value.</span></p>

Since our founding in 2015, we\'ve secured more than $156M in four funding series to help us grow into the company we are today, but we\'re not done yet.

<h3><strong>The Role</strong></h3>
<p>At Telnyx, we empower companies to build scalable, global communications products. As a Technical Implementation Engineer, you’ll work directly with our onboarding customers to implement, optimize, and execute their integrations on to the Telnyx platform. You won’t just help customers get started—you’ll be their partner in solving complex telecom and connectivity challenges.<br>
 From embedding real-time messaging into global FinTechs to scaling secure voice and AI infrastructure for HealthTech platforms, your work will shape how companies communicate at scale.<br>
 This is a hands-on, technical role where you\'ll act as a bridge between our cutting-edge telecom APIs, Mission Control Platform, and the real-world business systems of our customers.</p>
<h3><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h3>
<ul>
 <li>Own technical implementation end-to-end: You’ll lead onboarding for customers, translating their goals into technical success and custom configuration on the Telnyx platform.</li>
 <li>Develop solutions: Whether integrating SIP trunks with cloud PBXs or optimizing webhook delivery pipelines, you\'ll solve customer challenges using code, configuration, and creativity.</li>
 <li>Collaborate cross-functionally: Partner with Solutions Engineers, Product, and Support to ensure customer success through deployment and beyond.</li>
 <li>Deploy with impact: The cutting edge of AI innovation today is in real-time communications and your work will support those businesses and more.</li>
 <li>Continuously improve: Use customer feedback, onboarding metrics, and your own insights to iterate on the implementation process and help scale our technical onboarding playbooks.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What We’re Looking For</strong></h3>
<ul>
 <li>Technical Expertise: Proficiency with APIs, telecom systems (e.g. SIP, WebRTC, call routing), and cloud platforms. You’re comfortable writing and debugging code in Python, JavaScript, or similar.</li>
 <li>Systems Thinker: You can architect how Telnyx fits into a customer’s broader tech stack and anticipate integration challenges before they surface.</li>
 <li>Problem Solver: You love untangling technical puzzles and building solutions that stick.</li>
 <li>Customer-Facing Engineer: You’re just as comfortable diving into packet captures as you are leading a technical onboarding call with a CTO.</li>
 <li>Adaptable Collaborator: You thrive in dynamic, high-autonomy environments where each customer is different and the playbook evolves daily.</li>
 <li>Experience: 2+ years in a technical role—implementation engineering, customer engineering, solutions architecture, or a similar capacity.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Bonus Points For</strong></h3>
<ul>
 <li>Experience in telecom, VoIP, or programmable communications</li>
 <li>Familiarity with authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth, token-based auth)</li>
 <li>Experience with tools like Postman, Wireshark, or SIP debuggers</li>

 <p><strong>Company</strong>: AdsGency AI</p>
 <p>📍 <strong>Location</strong>: Onsite / SF Bay Area Preferred</p>
 <p>💼 <strong>Employment Type</strong>: Full-Time</p><strong>🚀 About AdsGency AI</strong>
 <p>We’re <strong>AdsGency AI</strong> — a hacker-founded startup building autonomous, multi-agent systems to run digital advertising with zero human input.</p>
 <p>Our product is a real-world application of AI agents that write ad copy, generate creatives, optimize budgets, launch campaigns, and learn from performance data — across Google, Meta, TikTok, and beyond.</p>
 <p><strong>Think</strong>: LLM agents that ship ROAS.</p>
 <p>We move like hackers, build in public, and write code that automates the world.</p><strong>🧠 The Role – Technical Product Manager (AI x AdTech)</strong>
 <p>You’ll be the <strong>architect of clarity</strong> across a fast-moving team of engineers, agents, and advertising logic.</p>
 <p>This isn’t just about managing roadmaps or grooming backlogs — it’s about <strong>owning the bridge between real users and autonomous systems</strong>, ensuring every feature is scoped, shipped, and scaled with ruthless clarity.</p>
 <p>You’ll work closely with founders, engineers, and GTM teams to define, prioritize, and ship agent-powered product experiences that generate real-world revenue.</p><strong>🔧 What You’ll Drive</strong>
 <p>• 🔍 <strong>Spec What Matters</strong> – Own and write clean, detailed specs that engineers <em>want</em> to build</p>
 <p>• 🤖 <strong>Agent Behavior Design</strong> – Collaborate on how LLM agents think, respond, and take action inside live ad campaigns</p>
 <p>• 🚦 <strong>Launch Planning &amp; Feedback Loops</strong> – Define what’s “done,” coordinate releases, gather real usage data, and close the loop</p>
 <p>• 📈 <strong>Use-Case Scoping</strong> – Work with clients and internal sales to define the right abstractions for each vertical (e.g. eCom vs SaaS)</p>
 <p>• ⚙️ <strong>Infra Awareness</strong> – Partner with engineering to understand technical constraints and shape roadmaps accordingly</p>
 <p>• 🧪 <strong>Test Agent Outputs in the Wild</strong> – Run experiments, track what breaks, and debug directly with the team</p>
 <p>• 🧠 <strong>Translate Chaos into Roadmaps</strong> – Ruthlessly prioritize what matters and drop what doesn’t</p><strong>💡 What We’re Looking For</strong>
 <p>✅ You’ve built or managed technical products — ideally involving LLMs, agents, or marketing automation</p>
 <p>✅ You’re technical enough to read code, write SQL, or debug APIs — even if you don’t write prod code</p>
 <p>✅ You’ve worked in fast-paced startups with no product babysitting required</p>
 <p>✅ You can write docs, PRDs, and updates that are clear, useful, and bottom-line aware</p>
 <p>✅ You’ve shipped messy v1s and polished v3s — and know when each is appropriate</p>
 <p>✅ You thrive in ambiguity and take ownership from 0 to done</p><strong>🧠 Bonus Hacker Energy</strong>
 <p>• You’ve run real ad campaigns and know what ROAS feels like</p>
 <p>• You’ve worked on agent orchestration, prompt design, or AI tool interfaces</p>
 <p>• You’ve written your own internal dashboards, scripts, or tools to unblock yourself</p>
 <p>• You’ve been the calm in a shipping storm — and loved it</p>
 <p>• You’ve served as product + ops + QA + support at once (and called it Tuesday)</p><strong>⚙️ Our Stack</strong>
 <p>• LLMs: OpenAI, Claude, HuggingFace, Ollama</p>
 <p>• Backend: Python, FastAPI, Postgres, Redis</p>
 <p>• Frontend: TypeScript, React</p>
 <p>• Infra: AWS, Railway, Supabase</p>
 <p>• Agents: LangGraph, CrewAI, Custom LLM pipelines</p>
 <p>• Tracking: PostHog, Sentry, Linear, Slack logs</p><strong>💰 What You Get</strong>
 <p>• Competitive salary + equity in a rocketship-stage AI company</p>
 <p>• Founding-level influence on what we build, why, and for whom</p>
 <p>• Direct exposure to real revenue, clients, and experiments that matter</p>
 <p>• A hacker-first team that prefers async clarity over management fluff</p>
 <p>• A seat at the table in defining agent-native product experiences</p>
 <p>• A chance to build the product that builds the ads that build the growth</p>
 <p>If you love turning vague goals into shipped impact — and want to define what “agentic product” even means — let’s talk.</p>
 <p>👉 Send us your weirdest product spec, smartest tradeoff, or the wildest thing you shipped in under a week.</p>

<p>As a Sr. Product Data Analyst, you\'ll be directly impacting our results through insights and reports. You\'ll be working close to product managers, researchers, and other business stakeholders, helping with prioritization, assessments, and business recommendations. It will be your responsibility, alongside the Analytics team, to nurture the data-driven culture within the company, making data easier to consume, be it through interactive reports, easy-to-use datasets, documentation, training.</p>
<p><strong>Help Us Build the Future of Outdoor Services</strong></p>
<p>At LawnStarter, we’re transforming the $100B+ outdoor home services industry—making it easier for homeowners to book, manage, and enjoy services like lawn care, landscaping, and more. With $30M+ in venture funding and solid traction, we’re investing in the next generation of our platform—and we’re looking for a Lead Software Engineer to help drive it.</p>
<p>📹<a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuyXhzGvo5s"> See what we are building!</a></p>
<p><strong>Problems to be solved</strong></p>
<p>Your primary responsibility will be to empower our organization to be more data-driven, and there are many ways to accomplish that, such as:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Modeling &amp; Analysis</strong>: A marketplace is a complex system, with various moving parts and often contradicting signals. That creates an extremely exciting pool of opportunities to find gaps, insights, or optimizations. The analysis and models we need have different degrees of complexity, from simple AB tests to multivariate models on retention or ETA. We expect you to have advanced experience in SQL and intermediate experience in Python or R.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Reporting</strong>: If a complex system creates an exciting pool of opportunities, it also creates a high number of metrics that we need to keep track of to run the business efficiently. However, a dashboard is only as good as our trust in being correct and updated. It’s your responsibility to understand the needs of the teams you’ll be working with and help the Analytics team create and maintain our reporting system, keeping it organized and user-friendly. For that, you’ll be mainly using Tableau and Metabase.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Analytics Engineering</strong>: Although it won’t be your main focus, occasionally, you will need to work on the inner layers of our Data Warehouse to provide clean and documented datasets to empower our reports and end users within the organization. Understanding the business needs and consolidating them into our DW is crucial to maintaining a reliable single source of truth. We use DBT for the data transformation, so SQL experience is a must.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Experience</strong>: You have 4+ years of experience in data &amp; analytics at data-driven companies.</li>
 <li><strong>Education</strong>: You have a STEM or business background or relevant education that makes you suited to empower our organization to be more data-driven.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Learning Mindset</strong>: You take pride in understanding problems deeply and asking the right questions. You can absorb a variety of topics with extreme ease, having a structured and logical approach to developing your understanding of the business and its challenges. This is unlikely to be a good fit if you have a preconceived system of processes and methods and plan on just applying them without first learning all the ways our business is unique.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Team player: </strong>You are ready to work alongside exceptional people, helping them achieve great results. You create an environment where people are excited to work with you daily, with intellectual honesty and trust.</li>
 <li><strong>Business focus</strong>: You care deeply about understanding business needs and how your analysis connects with our product, customers, and financials. You can envision how metrics drill down from the highest to the lowest level, identifying what needs to be analyzed or reported on each.</li>
 <li><strong>Bias for action</strong>: You understand that despite your careful approach to understanding problems and identifying opportunities, you actively try to avoid being a perfectionist or getting yourself tied up in knots. You have a bias for action in order to make progress. You enjoy being scrappy and constraints enthrall you. This is unlikely to be a good fit if you, by default, like building full solutions from the get-go.</li>

 <h2><strong>What You Will Do</strong></h2>
 <p>You’ll join our<strong> Build for Scale team</strong>, which owns <strong>internal tooling, automation</strong>, and <strong>operational infrastructure</strong>. As our team’s second hire, you’ll focus on capturing raw data from a wide array of sources (both structured and unstructured), and transforming it into clean, reliable systems that <strong>power reporting, automation, and AI implementations</strong> across the company. You’ll serve as the connective tissue between subject-matter experts (Legal, Accounting, Investments), internal tools, and data — automating where possible, structuring where needed. You’ll ship internal products quickly, <strong>balancing speed and scalability</strong>, all so the rest of the company can move faster and be more effective.</p>
 <h2><strong>How You Will Contribute</strong></h2>
 <p><strong>You will:</strong></p>
 <ul>

  <li><strong>Enable self-service analytics &amp; reporting</strong> – work with internal teams to define business-critical metrics and help guide the building of dashboards, reports, and ad-hoc analyses to surface accurate, actionable insights.</li>
 </ul>
 <p><strong>And ideally be able to:</strong></p>
 <ul>
  <li><strong>Build scalable data infrastructure &amp; pipelines</strong> – design, implement, and maintain lightweight ETLs that consolidate data from Salesforce, Coda, internal databases, external APIs, and other tools so information flows reliably as the business grows (using tools like Snowflake and Fivetran).</li>
  <li><strong>Model, monitor, and assure data quality</strong> – turn raw inputs into clean semantic layers and data marts, establish QA processes and documentation, and help create an agreed upon “single source of truth” for internal teams.</li>
  <li><strong>Own system integrations &amp; maintenance</strong> – keep data pipelines and operational systems healthy; debug workflows and data connections when they break.</li>
  <li><strong>Lay the foundation for future scalability</strong> – incrementally add structure, content, and best practices so that our systems scale into the future, and so that Product and Engineering teams can easily build robust internal tools on top of our infrastructure.</li>
 </ul>
 <h2><strong>What Makes a Great Fit</strong></h2>
 <p><strong>Having all traits/experience is </strong><strong><em>not necessary</em></strong><strong> – there are many ways to be valuable in this role.</strong></p>
 <p>You have <strong>2–5</strong> years of experience in any of:</p>

  <li>Comfortable building functional MVPs: shipping fast, iterating, and improving over time</li>
 </ul>
 <p><strong>Comfortable with Data</strong></p>
 <ul>
  <li>Strong with data: fluent in <strong>SQL</strong>, wrangling spreadsheets, and logic. Can answer critical business questions using data in a way that builds trust and understand business levers well enough to interpret data and make recommendations</li>
  <li>Have set up <strong>ETLs</strong> using tools like dbt, Airbyte, Fivetran, or custom scripts</li>
  <li>Understand API basics (GET/POST, JSON formats), and have hands-on experience working with <strong>APIs</strong>, webhooks, and lightweight scripting for integrations</li>
  <li>Know how to design <strong>semantic layers</strong> and define clean, well-modeled data marts</li>
  <li>Constantly bringing structure to everything</li>
 </ul>
 <p><strong>Systems Thinker &amp; Workflow Oriented</strong></p>
 <ul>
  <li>Can take a vague business process and turn it into a repeatable workflow</li>
  <li>Naturally reduce friction – by automating, documenting, or improving handoffs</li>
  <li>Always looking for a way to reduce manual error and inefficiency</li>
  <li>Motivated by building systems that create output — not just dashboards that track results</li>
 </ul>
 <h3><strong>Project Management &amp; Collaboration</strong></h3>

  <li>Cross-functional experience – can talk to Legal, Finance, Investments, and Product, and translate between them</li>
  <li>Comfortable running small projects, following up on dependencies, and closing loops</li>

<h3>About Sprout.ai</h3>
<p>Sprout.ai was established in London, UK in 2018 with a mission to help people in their time of need when making an insurance claim. Inefficient claims processing for the insurer meant that customer experience was suffering and people were losing faith in their insurance policies. The average insurance customer was having to wait over 25 days to receive an outcome on their claim, often in times of vulnerability.</p>
<p>The barriers to rapid claims settlement were clear; understanding of unstructured data, complexity and volume of decision making, legacy systems and processes.</p>
<p>Sprout.ai’s patented claims automation platform solves these challenges, and has already delivered instant claims settlement on millions of insurance claims around the world. Our proprietary AI products can automate every step of the claims journey: extracting and enhancing relevant claims data, cross-checking this with policies and providing recommendations to conclude a claim in near real-time. Our tools are allowing claims handlers to spend more time with customers, where human touch and empathy can make the most difference to their customers.</p>
<p>Leading VCs saw our company vision to ‘make every claim better’ and have supported our growth journey. This includes our $11M Series A led by Octopus Ventures in 2021 and in total we have raised over $20M.</p>');

 <p><strong>We’re AdsGency AI — a hacker-founded startup building autonomous, multi-agent systems</strong> to run digital advertising <strong>with zero human input</strong>.</p>
 <p>Our product is a real-world application of AI agents that <strong>write ad copy, generate creatives, optimize budgets, launch campaigns</strong>, and learn from performance data — across Google, Meta, TikTok, and beyond. Think: <strong>LLM agents that ship ROAS</strong>.</p>
 <p>We move like hackers, build in public, and write code that automates the world.</p>
 <p><strong>🧠 The Role – Member of Technical Staff, AI Agent (Multi-Agent Systems)</strong></p>
 <p><strong>You’ll be one of our core engineers</strong>, helping us build a deeply technical and highly autonomous agentic platform. You’ll work across the full stack — from LLM orchestration and decision logic to real-world action-taking agents in production.</p>
 <p>This is not a model research role. It’s not just prompt tuning. It’s real-world agent engineering:</p>
 <p><strong>LLMs with tools, memory, agency, and impact.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>🔧 What You’ll Build</strong></p>
 <p><strong> • 🤖 Agentic Ad Infrastructure</strong> – Build LLM agents that autonomously launch, optimize, and iterate ad campaigns</p>

 <p><strong>✅ You’ve built with LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGPT, or your own agent framework</strong></p>
 <p><strong>✅ You’ve used LLMs as coworkers (Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Tabnine, etc.)</strong></p>
 <p><strong>✅ You’ve shipped something weird, useful, or deeply technical with LLMs</strong></p>
 <p><strong>✅ You’re not afraid to scrap the framework and write your own orchestration engine</strong></p>
 <p><strong>✅ You’ve deployed agents in production, not just in Colab</strong></p>
 <p><strong>✅ You like CLI tools, traces, logs, and think about agents as systems with state</strong></p>
 <p><strong>🧠 Bonus Hacker Energy</strong></p>
 <p><strong> • You’ve scraped something and built a data pipeline in a weekend</strong></p>
 <p><strong> • You write shell scripts to automate your daily workflow</strong></p>
 <p><strong> • You use git blame to learn and ship faster</strong></p>
 <p><strong> • You’ve made PRs to open-source LLM tools or reverse-engineered APIs</strong></p>

 <p><strong>🎯 Who You Are</strong></p>
 <p><strong> • Hacker &gt; Engineer &gt; Researcher</strong></p>
 <p><strong> • 0-to-1 builder who ships scrappy before elegant</strong></p>
 <p><strong> • Comfortable in open-ended, ambiguous environments</strong></p>
 <p><strong> • Writes code in public, learns fast, fails fast, and debugs hard</strong></p>
 <p><strong> • Interested in real-world agent deployment</strong>,<strong> not just theoretical chains</strong></p>
 <p><strong>💰 What You Get</strong></p>
 <p><strong> • Competitive salary + real equity</strong></p>
 <p><strong> • Founding-level technical ownership</strong></p>
 <p><strong> • Direct access to revenue-generating use cases (ads that work)</strong></p>
 <p><strong> • Hacker-first culture with full engineering autonomy</strong></p>
 <p><strong> • Early-stage engineering imprint on an AI-native company</strong></p>
 <p><strong> • A team that writes code, not policies</strong></p>

</div>
<h2><strong>Principal Product Designer</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Help shape the future of AI commerce, from the foundations up.</strong></p>
<p>We’re looking for a Principal Product Designer to champion design across Alby’s multi-agent platform, a system that’s redefining how brands use AI to sell online. Our product blends cutting-edge LLM tech with deeply considered UX to guide shoppers, empower marketers, and orchestrate complex ecommerce workflows with simplicity and clarity.</p>
<p>As Principal Designer, you won’t just design interfaces. You’ll shape the experience strategy for a system of AI agents and their surrounding tooling. You’ll partner closely with founders and cross-functional leads to define design standards, lead large problem spaces, and set the tone for how design operates at Alby. As the second designer on a small-but-mighty team, this is a rare opportunity to help establish a design culture at a company building at the frontier of AI-powered commerce and beyond.</p>
<h3><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></h3>
<ul>
 <li>Define UX strategy for a multi-agent AI system, leading the design of experiences that serve merchants, marketers, and shoppers.</li>
 <li>Lead end-to-end design across high-impact projects. Complex admin tooling, agent playbooks, knowledge systems, response categorization, and more.</li>
 <li>Build systems that scale. From conversation design patterns to knowledge architecture to visual QA standards.</li>
 <li>Collaborate cross-functionally with product, engineering, and GTM teams to translate fuzzy AI behavior into legible, guided UX flows.</li>
 <li>Shape the structure and standards of our design org, from process to critique culture.</li>
 <li>Contribute to product and company strategy through a design lens, balancing high craft with high velocity.</li>
 <li>Champion usability, clarity, and visual excellence across the product. Help everyone at alby raise the bar.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>You Might Be a Fit If You…</strong></h3>
<ul>
 <li>Have 7+ years of experience designing complex software, ideally in AI, developer tools, or systems-heavy SaaS environments.</li>
 <li>Can think across multiple levels of abstraction—from atomic UI patterns to high-level agent orchestration.</li>
 <li>Thrive in ambiguity, balancing experimentation with systemization.</li>
 <li>Have a sharp eye for craft. You care deeply about visual hierarchy, interaction clarity, and information design.</li>
 <li>Communicate clearly and influence thoughtfully—whether giving feedback, presenting to leadership, or collaborating asynchronously.</li>
 <li>Are fluent in Lean UX, user research, fast shipping, and post-launch iteration.</li>
 <li>Believe that great design is as much about structure and logic as it is about polish and delight.</li>
 <li>Bring energy, curiosity, and empathy to every problem you touch.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What Makes This Role Unique</strong></h3>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Design at the frontier</strong>: You’ll be defining UX for emergent AI behavior, helping people trust, guide, and understand AI agents.</li>
 <li><strong>Multi-user complexity</strong>: Alby serves merchants, marketers, and shoppers—with unique UX needs across each.</li>
 <li><strong>Early-stage opportunity</strong>: We’re a small team with a big mission, and you’ll be a foundational design leader.</li>
 <li><strong>High autonomy and ownership</strong>: Design is a critical function at Alby. You’ll shape how the company thinks about product and user experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Salary Range:<br><br>
 $130,000 - $190,000 base salary</p>

   <p>La douane, c’est l’architecture cachée qui soutient le commerce mondial. C’est elle qui décide si une marchandise peut entrer, sortir, et à quel coût. Un univers de réglementations, de stratégies et d’expertise… qui, aujourd’hui, a rendez-vous avec la technologie.</p>
   <p>Chez Nabu, on ne se contente pas d’améliorer la douane : on la réinvente. Notre mission ? Créer le premier assistant en douane digital, un système intelligent qui génère des déclarations complètes, conformes et prêtes à être validées. Plus de paperasse interminable, plus d’erreurs coûteuses. Juste une douane fluide, rapide et fiable.</p>
   <p>Si vous voulez faire partie de cette révolution, on vous attend.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Tâches</h2>
  <div>
   <p>Votre mission est simple (mais cruciale) : garantir que ce qui sort de notre système est 100 % fiable, conforme et optimisé. Vous serez le chef d’orchestre de la qualité douanière chez Nabu, en pilotant le processus plutôt qu’en mettant les mains dans chaque déclaration.</p>
   <p>Concrètement, ça veut dire :</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Superviser la qualité et la conformité des déclarations générées par notre système.</li>
    <li>Structurer et améliorer le processus pour minimiser les erreurs et assurer une automatisation maximale.</li>
    <li>Travailler main dans la main avec notre équipe produit pour affiner les processus, le système et les services.</li>
    <li>Garder un œil sur la réglementation pour s’assurer que Nabu est toujours au top en matière de conformité douanière.</li>
    <li>Recruter et encadrer une équipe, car la mission est trop belle pour être menée en solo.</li>
   </ul>
  </div>
  <h2>Compétences requises</h2>
  <div>
   <p>Ce job est fait pour vous si :</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Vous avez passé quelques années à préparer des déclarations chez un RDE et savez ce que c\'est que de préparer des dossiers de qualité.</li>
    <li>Vous connaissez la douane comme votre poche, mais vous rêvez d’un rôle plus stratégique et transversal.</li>
    <li>Vous aimez autant la réglementation que l’innovation, et vous voyez la technologie comme une alliée.</li>
    <li>Vous aimez structurer, optimiser et améliorer plutôt que simplement exécuter.</li>
    <li>Vous avez envie de monter en responsabilités, de créer une équipe et de laisser une empreinte durable.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Pourquoi nous rejoindre ?</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Un rôle clé pour bâtir le futur de la douane.</li>
    <li>Une startup en pleine accélération, avec de vraies perspectives d’évolution.</li>
    <li>Un poste hybride entre expertise douanière, tech et management.</li>
    <li>Une aventure unique, loin des parcours classiques en douane.</li>
   </ul>
  </div>
  <h2>Avantages</h2>
  <div>
   <ul>
    <li>Animaux acceptés</li>

<p>At Help Scout, we’re on a mission to help businesses delight more customers<strong>. </strong>We’ve been on this journey since 2011, and today more than 12,000 companies use our platform to provide outstanding customer support. We’ve been <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/remote-culture/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">fully remote</a> from the beginning, and have a team of 140+ people all over the world.</p>
<p>We love crafting beautiful products and growing a business together, but we\'re also trying to do something bigger. We\'re building a company that brings out your best <em>and</em> leaves the world a better place — a company that seeks <strong>balance</strong> between profit and purpose. That\'s why we\'ve been a <a href="https://www.bcorporation.net/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Certified B Corporation</a> since 2019 and have <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/for-good/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">pledged 1%</a> of our equity back to the community.</p>
<p>Help Scout’s success hinges on hiring talented, high-accountability people who want to be part of creating a culture where we all feel challenged and supported to do our best work. We hope that excites you to join us!</p>
<h2><strong>Company values</strong></h2>
<h3><em>Happy to Help</em></h3>
<p>Help is our first name. We show up for others, not because we have to, but because we want to. We share knowledge and give freely by default, and operate with generosity and empathy for each other, our customers, and our community. After all, there is no I in team (or software).</p>
<h3><em>Craft over Convention</em></h3>
<p>Although it’s tempting to follow a well-worn path, we push ourselves to run beyond it — even when that sets us apart from our peers. We’re building a culture where it’s safe to be ambitious and hold each other to high standards. That’s why we obsess over the last 10%, because it shows up for our customers and the business in powerful ways.</p>
<h3><em>Progress not Perfection</em></h3>
<p>The work of building a product, culture, and brand is never done – we ship our best effort, listen, iterate, then repeat. Seeking progress requires the vulnerability to be curious, humble, and hungry to learn. Great ideas can come from anywhere, so we share our work openly, welcome the perspective of others, and continuously search for what can be improved.</p>
<h3><em>Own the Outcome </em></h3>
<p>Ownership is key to our collective success. We consider the impact on our team and our community before we act, and believe that trust and integrity are non-negotiable. To create a better future, our decisions are made with stakeholders today <em>and</em> ten years from now in mind.</p>

<h2>Opportunity</h2>
<p>Help Scout was a pioneer in the early days of B2B SaaS content. Our <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">blog</a> has been a well-loved source of truth, comfort, and actionable advice in the customer support community and the key driver of our growth. As the search landscape changes and our market gets more crowded, we’ve adjusted our approach to get more leverage from other marketing channels. We’ll never outspend our competitors, but we’re investing more than ever in paid marketing to accelerate signups, expand brand awareness, and optimize our digital presence. Now, we need an expert to help us hone our strategy.</p>
<p>We’re looking for a scrappy, data-driven performance marketer to grow and scale Help Scout’s paid marketing channels. We’ve got a best-in-market product story, strong creative assets, and stellar copywriting — all we need is the right person to help us with distribution and optimization. If you thrive in a fast-paced, test-driven environment and want to enhance an early-stage paid marketing motion, we want to meet you.</p>
<h2>About the role</h2>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p><strong>Develop, own, and communicate paid marketing metrics</strong>. As the owner of the paid signups number, you’ll define, track and report out on key performance indicators and provide insights and recommendations to leadership. You know what’s needed from each channel to hit your number, and if something’s off, you’ve got a plan B to get there.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p><strong>Manage and optimize our always-on campaigns</strong>. You’ll lead iteration of ad copy and creative assets, bidding strategies and budget allocation to drive volume and gain efficiency in paid search and Google display network.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p><strong>Experiment with new paid channels. </strong> You’ll identify opportunities for new channel investments (paid social, affiliate, direct mail, OOH), drive alignment with leadership, launch campaigns and create the game plan for evaluating their performance.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p><strong>Collaborate to enhance organic acquisition. </strong>Partnering with our content team, social producer and SEO contractor, you’ll identify ways for paid and organic channels to work in harmony.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>About you</h2>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>You have a scrappy, results-driven mindset— you’re comfortable working with ambiguity and appreciate how constraints force you to out-creative the competition</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>You’re a paid media expert with vast experience across paid channels. You know the search landscape and the ideal benchmarks for paid alphabet soup (PPC, CPM, and ROAS).</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>You have strong analytical skills with experience using Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, and attribution tools</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>You know how to execute rapid experimentation and adapt your strategy based on data insights</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>You have excellent verbal and written communication skills, and are adept at presenting performance insights and strategies to cross-functional teams and senior leaders</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>You’re comfortable operating on a lean team and with a modest budget</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Who you\'ll work with</h2>

<h2>A note on the use of AI in our interview process</h2>

<p>On our end, we utilize a platform called Brighthire as a notetaker and review tool to ensure a fair and transparent hiring process.</p>

 <p><b><span>About<span> sees.ai</span></span></b><br></p>
 <p><span>sees.ai is a UK-based, Boeing-backed technology company pioneering autonomous drone operations for close inspection of critical national infrastructure — starting with the electricity grid. We are the first company in the UK (and one of the first globally) to receive routine BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) permissions in non-segregated airspace.</span><br></p>
 <p><span> </span><br></p>
 <p><span>Our solution delivers higher quality inspection data with dramatically lower cost, carbon, and risk — and is now entering commercial rollout with National Grid and other major European operators. We’re now seeking a Senior Commercial Lead — a hands-on, senior individual contributor who thrives in ambiguity, closes complex deals, and helps shape our early go-to-market strategy.</span><br></p>
 <p><span> </span><br></p>
 <p><span>This is a critical role for someone who can drive commercial success while the market is still forming. We want your experience in building out the function and establishing best practices — but not at the expense of winning business.</span><br></p>
 <p><span> </span><br></p>
 <p><span>This is a “builder &amp; closer” track role: start by closing deals, and if successful, help formalise and scale the commercial function. You’ll help shape how the company and market adapt to each other — deal by deal — as we learn not just how to sell, but how buyers evolve their thinking, expectations, and readiness in response to what we offer.</span><br></p>
 <p><span> </span><br></p>
 <p><span>We’re looking for an Explorer — someone energised by new terrain, motivated by learning through doing, and skilled at building structure where there is none.</span><br></p>
 <p><span> </span><br></p>
 <p><b><span>The Role<span> </span><span> </span></span></b><br></p>
 <p><span>You’ll work directly with the CEO and senior team to develop, test, and evolve our go-to-market motion. You’ll also be responsible for moving live opportunities to closure, shaping commercial structures, and feeding real-time market intelligence back into the company.</span><br></p>
 <p><span> </span><br></p>
 <p><span>You won’t start with a team — but you’ll work closely with the founder on every major commercial opportunity in a co-selling, feedback-rich environment. As we grow, you’ll have the opportunity to shape the commercial function around you. For now, the focus is execution: converting demand into revenue and insight. And since early performance metrics evolve, you’ll help us define what success looks like along the way.</span><br></p>
 <p><span> </span><br></p>
 <p><b><span>Responsibilities<span> </span><span> </span></span></b><br></p>

  <b>SUMMARY</b>
 </div>
 <div>
  Artera is looking for a collaborative, empathetic, and growth-minded Engineering Manager to lead our product team, ReferRum, in Hungary. This team is responsible for building the patient data and referral infrastructure that powers critical functionality across the Artera platform—including patient communication preferences, referral insights, visit history, and contact data. Think of it as a CRM for patients—but smarter and more deeply integrated into healthcare delivery.
 </div>
 <div>
  This is a unique opportunity to lead a highly skilled team of engineers, helping them grow and stay engaged while collaborating cross-functionally with product, design, and other engineering teams across the US and Hungary. We\'re not looking for someone to write code daily, but you should be technically proficient and comfortable participating in code reviews, design discussions, and supporting your team in making high-quality technical decisions. Whether you\'ve formally managed people or acted as a team lead, we\'re looking for a servant leader who wants to help others grow while continuing to evolve their own leadership toolkit.

 <span><strong>About the Avionics Team</strong></span>
 <p>At Zipline, the Avionics Team is at the heart of our autonomous flight systems, responsible for designing, building, and testing the electronic and software systems that enable our drones to navigate, communicate, and deliver critical supplies with precision and reliability. From custom circuit board design, EOL tester development, and sensor integration to real-time flight control and communication systems, the team ensures our platforms operate safely and effectively in some of the most challenging environments in the world. The team works cross-functionally with mechanical, test, embedded, software, and systems engineering teams to create scalable, high-performance avionics that power life-saving missions every day.</p><strong>About the Role</strong>
 <p>Leading the way in drone delivery often means exceeding the capabilities of what\'s available off the shelf, and as a result we are engineering the majority of our system in-house. Doubling down on the reliability of our systems is critical to delivering to our next billion customers--people whose lives will be meaningfully affected by smarter, more equitable access. We are deliberately expanding our electrical design and test capabilities and adding to the ranks of our experienced team to achieve these goals.</p>
 <p>We need dedicated engineers to burn down risk and improve reliability in our system like their life depends on it, because others\' lives do. Electronics are where software meets the physical world, and so our electrical engineering team has a wide array of engineering skills and works with a variety of different teams. We need people who are comfortable working in different domains, thrive when working on a problem as part of a small group, and are able to communicate technical concepts clearly to a wide variety of stakeholders--software and mechanical engineers, hardware test and manufacturing, and operations and field support, to name a few. Our small team can get a lot done because our team members are strong individual contributors with a good grasp of electrical engineering fundamentals and the ability to define requirements for their systems, rapidly develop creative and simple solutions, and prove with testing that their work meets the rigors and edge-cases of real-world deployment.</p><span><strong>What You\'ll Do</strong></span>
 <p>You\'ll have your own projects but we haven\'t been saving an "intern project" - you\'ll be a full member of our team, and like with our other engineers, we\'ll work with you to find projects that align with your goals and interests and the team\'s and company\'s priorities.</p>
 <p>Examples of previous projects for interns include:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Prototyping new versions of our battery charging electronics to meet harsher environmental requirements in new countries where we\'re launching our service</li>
  <li>Architecting ground support electronics to assist the air vehicle with take-off and landing</li>
  <li>Developing and deploying test equipment such as EOL’s for design validation and production</li>
  <li>Supporting design validation campaigns to ensure that our avionics products meet design and reliability requirements</li>
  <li>Root cause investigation for our products from test, flight, or field issues.</li>
 </ul><span><strong>What You\'ll Bring </strong></span>
 <p>The part of your application we\'re most interested in is "prior engineering experience," somewhat broadly defined. We would like the following three things to be true:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Must have at least completed the second year of your Undergraduate studies. Masters and PhD students are also eligible.</li>
  <li>You\'ve designed and tested a custom circuit board (it doesn\'t need to have worked - we\'d love to hear about it!)</li>
  <li>You\'ve worked on a project in or out of school that moved under its own power (plane, car, boat, quadcopter, rocket, balloon, rocket on a balloon, submarine, rover, etc. - we\'re not picky)</li>
  <li>You\'ve collaborated on the above two things as part of a group - school club, competition team, as part of a job/internship, or just with friends</li>
  <li>In your application, we\'d love to see either a sample of work you\'re proud of or a short note about your prior experience and how it relates to the three points above.</li>

Trusted by over 15,000 ecommerce brands, Gorgias supports growing independent shops to globally recognizable brands.</p>
<p>Built for Shopify and powered by advanced ecommerce integrations, Gorgias\'s conversational AI understands your brand, tools, policies, and customers to drive personalized, 1-to-1 conversations — from editing orders and initiating returns to making product recommendations. Gorgias, where every customer interaction feels personal, support becomes sales, and conversations shape success.</p>
<h2>About the Platform Streaming team</h2>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Event data is at the center of Gorgias’s architecture &amp; product. This platform team is defining how we shape and transmit events across all of our systems. The team ensures that systems these events cross are built with consistency, reliability &amp; scalability in mind. We’re also working towards a mature <a href="https://www.datamesh-architecture.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Data Mesh Architecture</a>.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In the team, we\'re big users of Kafka, GCP PubSub, RabbitMQ as brokers. Debezium for CDC &amp; Stream processing frameworks (Kafka Connect, Kafka Streams &amp; Apache Flink). Flink is used in the majority of our streaming processing workloads. In terms of storage we’re using primarily using Postgres (OLTP), ElasticSearch (Full Text Search), Clickhouse (customer facing OLAP workloads) &amp; BigQuery (for internal use only).</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>The team directly owns services that are used by other product engineering teams like the Flink Operator, Debezium &amp; Webhook Infra and ensures data consistency, high quality of service and support. For Kafka &amp; PubSub we’re using a managed service - which is mostly around monitoring &amp; operational work.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>The team also provides common functionality &amp; SDKs to move data around, for instance feeding Caches and other storages like Elasticsearch, Redis, BigQuery, etc. The goal is to make those self-service for every other team to leverage.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>The team runs office-hours, workshops and sometimes works embedded in product teams to build systems that cannot be done with a self-service approch or the data streaming expertise is missing. The team helps building the system, trains the target team and reverts back to the team platform team. It does not remain on call for everything they help build.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>The team is currently composed of 6 Senior Engineers and the majority of their work is on platform systems that are offered as services to other teams.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>This team is NOT: IT data, data governance, batch processing and feeding data warehouses. The team is focused on delivering high-quality data within the product and providing an interface to external stakeholders.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>What You\'ll Do</h2>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Contribute to the Platform team vision and own the Platform streaming and the broader Event Driven Architecture vision &amp; strategy.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Design and build scalable &amp; reliable event driven systems with other senior platform engineers that are used by product engineering teams.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Work closely with senior management, product and other managers with the goal to expand our internal Platform and shape our whole architecture, you need to build a good rapport with your peers and bring Platform to them and vice-versa.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>You will take part of the broader engineering vision when it comes to OLTP, OLAP &amp; events storage design, how to shape events and messages, service-to-service communication, schema management, events lifecycle, contract negotiations of managed services vendors and more.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Manage a team of very 6 very senior engineers and ensure that the team delivers impact that affects the entire company.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>You will be reporting directly to the CTO.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Who You Are</h2>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>3+ years in an Engineering Manager role.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>5+ years of experience with Kafka ecosystem. Apache Flink experience is a big plus.</p></li>
 <li>

We attract people with conviction who are willing to bring new ideas and perspectives to a problem that affects everyone on the planet.</p>
<p>At MAX, you’ll have a unique opportunity to align your passion with a meaningful mission.</p>
<p>You will get a real opportunity to grow and make a real lasting impact on the lives of millions of people, and help deliver access to safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable transportation.</p>
<p>Our Mission:</p>
<p><br>
 We are Powering Africa’s Forward Movement, and this is being actualized through our transformative Mission: Making mobility safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable through the deployment of high-performance technology and operators.</p>
<p>We are building the largest vehicle subscription and financial services platform for commercial drivers and transport operators across Africa. Our proprietary technology is enabling Drivers with no banking history to access low to zero emission vehicles, insurance, digital wallets and eHailing services on a subscription basis. From 2019 to 2020, we scaled from 200 to more than 10,000 drivers and have raised more than $40m to achieve our mission. Our goal is to serve 14million gig drivers across Africa\'s $250B mobility industry. In the short term, we are scaling our impact to 100,000 drivers across 10 cities in 3 countries.</p>
<p>Our Values:<br><br>
 In everything we do, we uphold these 5 values without compromise;</p>
<ul>
 <li>Transparency: We’re taking everyone along for the ride.</li>
 <li>Integrity: We stand by our word to remain consistent with all parties, including you!</li>
 <li>Initiative: We prioritize ingenious ideas and nurture them which has brought us this far and we’re not stopping now.</li>
 <li>Partnership: We always keep the welcome mat rolled out on MAX Land; everyone is welcome.</li>
 <li>Safety: Safety to us at MAX means taking all road safety precautions, telling others about safety so that mobility is safe and comfortable for all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Impact:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Financial Inclusion: We fill a critical funding gap for informal operators in Africa by arranging credit to drivers and micro-entrepreneurs who have few credible options.</li>
 <li>Economic Empowerment: We have onboarded +15000 drivers onto our platform with thousands more in the pipeline in a bid to fulfil the transportation needs in Africa.</li>
 <li>Sustainable Job Creation: We are creating direct and indirect jobs through income-generating assets, technology, and continuous skill development training.</li>
 <li>Transport Infrastructure: Our drivers are professionals and can guarantee high quality of service and safety to passengers.</li>
 <li>Environmental Sustainability: We are deploying electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, and battery swapping stations to propel the transition to clean mobility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Investors and Strategic Partners:</p>
<p>MAX has raised $40m in funding to date, from strategic and financial investors including Yamaha, Mastercard, Shell Foundation, Novastar, Alitheia Capital, Goodwell Investments, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Techstars, and DLM Capital. Its Series A round for $7.5m closed in June 2019 after which the company announced plans to pilot and scale the assembly and deployment of Electric Vehicles (EVs) across Africa. Max expects that 31% of its fleet will be made up of EVs by 2024 and 69% by 2026.</p>

<p>Wunder is building a Modern Energy Company.</p>
<p>We were founded with one simple vision: to address the greatest crisis of our generation by accelerating the deployment of solar energy. In doing so, we help businesses, municipalities, and schools save money by delivering clean on-site power. We convert simple warehouses into electrified industrial platforms built for the future. We enable the nation’s leading commercial and industrial real estate firms to capture the benefits of solar across their properties. We align ESG goals with revenue targets, and the renewable energy assets we’re deploying today will power America’s tomorrow.</p>
<p>Wunder is actively developing hundreds of commercial solar projects across the country. Our team has evaluated more than 30,000 properties for solar across all 50 states to meet our customers where they are—which is everywhere! Our customers have a national footprint and so do we. Wunder’s proprietary technology platform enables us to develop solar at scale, across a portfolio that includes everything from self-storage facilities and schools to data centers and industrial logistics facilities. Our average solar system—about 430 kilowatts in size—can offset 350,000 pounds of coal burned each year of system operation!</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Role</h3>
<p>We have an amazing opportunity for a results-oriented, force multiplying professional to join our growing team, solve hard problems, and push renewable energy forward. We’re looking for someone who works quickly and efficiently, sees the forest and the trees while managing projects and teams, and isn’t afraid of a challenge. Our team is rapidly acquiring commercial customers and developing solar across the country alongside our national network of solar partners, and we need your help!</p>
<p>This is a roll-up-your-sleeves, get-it-done, execution-first position designed for someone who thrives in ambiguity, brings order to chaos, and wants to help scale Wunder’s commercial solar deployment to gigawatt scale. Initially, you’ll be laser-focused on Wunder’s Project Development function: driving solar projects forward, unblocking bottlenecks, improving delivery systems, and ensuring outcomes across our national portfolio. You’ll collaborate deeply with execution and technology teams cross-functionally to leverage Wunder’s proprietary software platform to accelerate the speed of project delivery, encode learnings, and unlock execution at scale in the commercial &amp; industrial solar sector.</p>
<p>At every stage, you’ll focus on exceeding customer expectations with clear communication, ahead-of-schedule deliverables, thoughtful project plans, and seamless execution. You’ll anticipate and mitigate risks that could impact timeline or cost, while identifying patterns and operational insights across the portfolio that allow us to optimize our work at the macro level.</p>
<p>You’ll be expected to understand and influence how work gets done at Wunder—and then make it happen faster, better, and more predictably. If you get excited about unlocking the untapped commercial and industrial solar market, joining a team designed for hyper-growth, and building an organization aimed at saving the world, then this is the role for you.</p>

<h3>About You</h3>
<ul>
 <li><em>You Are The Best Executor You Know</em> - You have 5–7+ years of managing complex projects, teams, and cross-functional initiatives and have a proven track record of meeting and exceeding critical business goals. You strive for operational excellence in everything you do and elevate your team and colleagues to do the same. You turn problems into clear plans and drive them forward with urgency and precision.<br><br></li>
 <li><em>Communication Is Your Superpower</em> - You know what to say, when to say it, and who needs to hear it. You adapt your communication style to the stakeholder needs and can seamlessly shift from external partner management to internal executive presentations with ease.<br><br></li>
 <li><em>You’re Detail Oriented &amp; Organized </em>- You’re meticulous and take a “zero defect” approach to problem solving and deliverables. You see the forest and the trees. You understand the goal of a project, break it down into workable components, track the work, the risks, the timelines, and the people, and do it all while keeping stakeholders well-informed throughout the process.<br><br></li>
 <li><em>You Thrive In Ambiguity </em>- When there’s no roadmap, you draw one. When things break, you rebuild them stronger. You create organization from chaos.<br><br></li>
 <li><em>You Have A Growth Mindset</em> - You’re not just open to new ideas, you actively seek them out. You approach every task with the ambition to learn and evolve. Your growth mindset is evident in your ability to question the status quo and drive forward with creative and effective solutions that push the boundaries of what\'s possible in solar development.<br><br></li>
 <li><em>You Believe That No Problem is Too Hard</em> - In an industry where people are constantly stuck, we find ways to get it done. You know how to articulate and roll out solutions, recognizing there are many solutions to the same problem. You find new and effective ways to streamline and create processes to increase efficiency. You think in repeatable frameworks, not one-offs.<br><br></li>
 <li><em>You Have A Beginner\'s Mind </em>- You don’t have experience in solar—and that’s a plus. Wunder does things differently. You seek to understand market norms for what they can teach us, but you’re an independent thinker who knows the market hasn’t solved the problems we’re tackling. You’re hungry to solve hard problems from first principles. If you do have any solar experience, you’re ready to leave it at the door and challenge your own assumptions.<br><br></li>
 <li><em>You Have A Team Ethos</em> - You thrive in a creative, inventive, fast-paced rapid-growth environment, with people who are passionate about their work and mission. You’re not just excited to work cross-functionally, you crave it.<br><br></li>
 <li><em>You\'re Flexible, a Quick Responder</em> - The problem we’re trying to solve as an organization is dynamic and each day brings fresh and exciting challenges. You can react quickly and efficiently when called upon to change or pivot.<br><br></li>

    <li>Excellent communicator who can debate strategy, persuade stakeholders, and tell a crisp product story.</li>
    <li>Thrive in fast-moving, ambiguous environments and love turning ideas into shippable software.</li>
    <li>Comfortable working hybrid/remote in a UK-friendly time-zone; ideally Northern Ireland (no visa sponsorship).</li>
    <li>Nice to Haves:
     <ul>
      <li>Workplace-tech or facilities-management domain experience.</li>
      <li>Formal UX/UI design training or side projects that ooze visual taste.</li>

<p>As a Product Data Specialist, you\'ll be directly impacting our results through insights and reports. You\'ll be working close to product managers, researchers, and other business stakeholders, helping with prioritization, assessments, and business recommendations. It will be your responsibility, alongside the Analytics team, to nurture the data-driven culture within the company, making data easier to consume, be it through interactive reports, easy-to-use datasets, documentation, training.</p>
<p><strong>Help Us Build the Future of Outdoor Services</strong></p>
<p>At LawnStarter, we’re transforming the $100B+ outdoor home services industry—making it easier for homeowners to book, manage, and enjoy services like lawn care, landscaping, and more. With $30M+ in venture funding and solid traction, we’re investing in the next generation of our platform—and we’re looking for a Lead Software Engineer to help drive it.</p>
<p>📹<a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuyXhzGvo5s"> See what we are building!</a></p>
<p><strong>Problems to be solved</strong></p>
<p>Your primary responsibility will be to empower our organization to be more data-driven, and there are many ways to accomplish that, such as:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Modeling &amp; Analysis</strong>: A marketplace is a complex system, with various moving parts and often contradicting signals. That creates an extremely exciting pool of opportunities to find gaps, insights, or optimizations. The analysis and models we need have different degrees of complexity, from simple AB tests to multivariate models on retention or ETA. We expect you to have advanced experience in SQL and intermediate experience in Python or R.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Reporting</strong>: If a complex system creates an exciting pool of opportunities, it also creates a high number of metrics that we need to keep track of to run the business efficiently. However, a dashboard is only as good as our trust in being correct and updated. It’s your responsibility to understand the needs of the teams you’ll be working with and help the Analytics team create and maintain our reporting system, keeping it organized and user-friendly. For that, you’ll be mainly using Tableau and Metabase.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Analytics Engineering</strong>: Although it won’t be your main focus, occasionally, you will need to work on the inner layers of our Data Warehouse to provide clean and documented datasets to empower our reports and end users within the organization. Understanding the business needs and consolidating them into our DW is crucial to maintaining a reliable single source of truth. We use DBT for the data transformation, so SQL experience is a must.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Experience</strong>: You have 4+ years of experience in data &amp; analytics at data-driven companies.</li>
 <li><strong>Education</strong>: You have a STEM or business background or relevant education that makes you suited to empower our organization to be more data-driven.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Learning Mindset</strong>: You take pride in understanding problems deeply and asking the right questions. You can absorb a variety of topics with extreme ease, having a structured and logical approach to developing your understanding of the business and its challenges. This is unlikely to be a good fit if you have a preconceived system of processes and methods and plan on just applying them without first learning all the ways our business is unique.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Team player: </strong>You are ready to work alongside exceptional people, helping them achieve great results. You create an environment where people are excited to work with you daily, with intellectual honesty and trust.</li>
 <li><strong>Business focus</strong>: You care deeply about understanding business needs and how your analysis connects with our product, customers, and financials. You can envision how metrics drill down from the highest to the lowest level, identifying what needs to be analyzed or reported on each.</li>
 <li><strong>Bias for action</strong>: You understand that despite your careful approach to understanding problems and identifying opportunities, you actively try to avoid being a perfectionist or getting yourself tied up in knots. You have a bias for action in order to make progress. You enjoy being scrappy and constraints enthrall you. This is unlikely to be a good fit if you, by default, like building full solutions from the get-go.</li>

       <p>Votre mission est simple (mais cruciale) : garantir que ce qui sort de notre système est 100 % fiable, conforme et optimisé. Vous serez le chef d’orchestre de la qualité douanière chez Nabu, en pilotant le processus plutôt qu’en mettant les mains dans chaque déclaration.</p>
       <p>Concrètement, ça veut dire :<br>
        • Superviser la qualité et la conformité des déclarations générées par notre système.<br>
        • Structurer et améliorer le processus pour minimiser les erreurs et assurer une automatisation maximale.<br>
        • Travailler main dans la main avec notre équipe produit pour affiner les processus, le système et les services.<br>
        • Garder un œil sur la réglementation pour s’assurer que Nabu est toujours au top en matière de conformité douanière.<br>
        • Recruter et encadrer une équipe, car la mission est trop belle pour être menée en solo.</p>

           We wondered: “If the manufacturing world is creating so many sustainable alternatives, why are companies not using them to make more sustainable products?” What we learned after 100+ interviews with scientists and R&amp;D operators is that leaders don’t know what to do. They have committed to ambitious climate goals with no concrete path to achieve them. There are a growing variety of sustainable products and solutions, but evaluating their feasibility is a complex, time-consuming process that requires a lot of expertise. Most experts in the industry don’t have that time to spare. What if you knew for every process design decision what the most sustainable alternative approach was? We want to make this a reality.

  <li>Experience at tech-forward or modern SaaS startups</li>
 </ol>
 <p>About the company:</p>
 <p>This fast-growing, remote-first startup is building modern software for accounting and bookkeeping firms.

The platform helps firms catch accounting errors, deliver cleaner reports, and scale their operations more efficiently. Following a successful Series A fundraise, they are expanding rapidly, with a focus on building a world-class sales team to drive continued growth across North America.</p>
 <p>Role Summary</p>

  <li>AEs are responsible for closing 15–20 deals/month, managing a mix of inbound demos and 20% self-sourced outbound pipeline.</li>

 <ol>
  <li>30-minute product demos with 5–10 mins discovery + 15–20 mins product walkthrough</li>

  <li>Growth opportunities include promotion to higher AE tiers after 12 months and potential team lead/manager roles as the team scales to 20–30 AEs by year-end.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Compensation &amp; Structure</p>

  <li>OTE Range: $110K–$150K (uncapped commission)</li>
